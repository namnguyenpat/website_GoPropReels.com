# How to Conquer the 100K Challenge?

Most traders fail not because they lack a strategy, but because they lack discipline in Risk Management.

## 3 Golden Rules to Protect Your Account:
1. **The 1% Rule**: Never risk more than 1% of your capital on a single trade.
2. **Patience is Key**: Don't force trades every day. Enter only when the setup is perfect.
3. **Know the Script**: Every firm like Maven or Funding Pips has different Drawdown rules. Read them carefully before you start.

Passing the challenge isn't hard if you have a steady mindset and a detailed plan.

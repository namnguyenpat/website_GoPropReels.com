# Facing the Fear in Trading

The fear of losing money is often greater than the joy of winning. This is exactly why you can't hold winning trades long enough.

## How to Overcome It?
- **Trust the System**: If you've backtested your system, let it do its job.
- **Process Over Outcome**: Don't stare at the PnL. Stare at the chart and the execution.
- **Master the Journal**: Writing down your emotions during an entry will help you recognize recurring mistakes.

A trader's character is forged through losses, not through random wins.

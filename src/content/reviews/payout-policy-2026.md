# Payout Policy Changes for 2026

The year 2026 brings new KYC regulations and processing times at international prop firms.

## Essential Points to Note:
- **Biometric Verification**: Enhanced security protocols for professional traders.
- **Scheduled Payouts**: Some firms are moving to a 14-day cycle instead of on-demand to stabilize liquidity.
- **Crypto Integration**: The massive rise of USDT (TRC-20) as the fastest payout method.

### Understanding Drawdown: The Heart of Risk Management

If you want to keep your funded account, you must understand how your firm calculates drawdown. It's the #1 reason why traders lose their accounts.

#### 1. Trailing Drawdown
The most common and most difficult. This drawdown "trails" your highest open profit in real-time. If you are up $500 and then the trade pulls back to break-even, your drawdown limit has moved up with it. 

#### 2. End of Day (EOD) Drawdown
Much more trader-friendly. The drawdown limit is only updated based on your account balance at the end of the trading day. This allows for intra-day swings without suffocating your account.

#### 3. Relative vs. Absolute Drawdown
Some firms use an absolute number ($1,500 limit), while others use a percentage. Always read the fine print before clicking 'Buy'.

### Why It Matters
A strategy that works on an EOD firm might blow up on a Trailing firm. Choose your firm based on your strategy's volatility.

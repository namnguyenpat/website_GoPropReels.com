### February 2026: A Month of Massive Payouts

The prop trading industry continues to evolve at breakneck speed. This month, we've seen record-breaking payouts from top-tier firms and a shift towards more transparent drawdown rules.

#### Apex Trader Funding Sets New Records
Apex has reportedly paid out over $10 million to traders in the first half of February alone. Their "No Daily Drawdown" model continues to be the preferred choice for futures traders looking for flexibility.

#### Regulatory Watch
New discussions around industry standards are emerging. While the landscape remains open, firms are increasingly adopting 'True STP' models to ensure long-term sustainability and trader trust.

#### What's Next?
Expect more 'Instant Funding' models to launch this spring. Speed is the name of the game in 2026.

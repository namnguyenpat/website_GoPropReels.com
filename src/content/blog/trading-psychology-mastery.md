### The Silent Killer of Funded Accounts

You have the strategy. You have the risk management plan. You even have the perfect prop firm evaluation account. Yet, you find yourself hitting the daily drawdown limit or revenge trading after a minor loss.

Success in prop trading is **20% strategy and 80% mindset**.

#### 1. The Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)
In the world of 24/7 markets, the urge to click 'Buy' or 'Sell' just because a candle is moving fast is overwhelming. Professional traders wait for their setup. Amateur traders chase the market.

#### 2. Revenge Trading
After a loss, the ego wants to 'take back' what the market took. This leads to oversized positions and breaking rules. Acknowledge the loss, step away from the screen, and return only when you are calm.

#### 3. The Goal is Consistency, Not Perfection
A 50% win rate with a 2:1 Reward-to-Risk ratio is a gold mine. Stop trying to win every trade. Focus on executing your plan perfectly every time.

**The Verdict:** Your mind is your most valuable asset. Protect it.
